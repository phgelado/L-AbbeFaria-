Over the past decade, Nigeria's GDP has been fluctuating due to various factors such as fluctuations in oil prices, political instability, and insurgencies. In 2011, Nigeria's GDP was $244 billion, and it grew to $568 billion in 2014 due to record-high oil prices. However, in 2015, the GDP contracted to $481 billion due to a fall in oil prices. Since then, the GDP has been fluctuating and was at $448 billion in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the economy. Despite the fluctuations, Nigeria's economy remains the largest in Africa in terms of GDP, accounting for 29% of the continent's total GDP.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "It seems like Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on oil prices. Are there any efforts to diversify the economy to reduce this reliance?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yes, efforts have been made by the Nigerian government to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil. A program called the Nigerian Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) was launched in 2017 to focus on diversifying the economy in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and technology. The plan aims to achieve a more balanced economic structure by 2020.\n\nOther initiatives and reforms have been implemented to support economic diversification, such as improving infrastructure, attracting foreign investment, and promoting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The government also launched the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) to promote industrialization and increase the manufacturing sector's contribution to the GDP.\n\nAlthough these efforts have been slow and there is still a long way to go in diversifying the economy, there have been some successes. For example, the agricultural sector has shown promising growth, and Nigeria is now one of the world's top producers of some crops such as cassava and yams. The manufacturing sector has also seen some growth, with some companies making investments in infrastructure and modernization. Overall, diversifying the economy is seen as crucial for sustainable economic growth and reducing Nigeria's vulnerability to oil price shocks.", "role": "assistant"}]}

The two had grown up together, gone to the same school, and had never been apart for more than a month. They knew everything about each other.\n\nBut their respective romantic partners' relationship was a different story. As much as Jack was in love with Lily, he had to face the harsh reality that Lily would never return to him the same way. So, Jack moved on and found himself in a committed relationship with someone else.\n\nJane was Jack's new girlfriend, a charming and intelligent woman who quickly became good friends with Lily as well. At first, the three of them would hang out together, finding common ground and sharing laughs. But as time passed, Jack's commitments were brought to other things, and Lily was left alone with Jane.\n\nThat's when the awkwardness started. Lily would try to engage Jane in conversation, but Jane was always a bit distant. Lily thought nothing of it at first, assuming that Jane was simply unfamiliar with her. But then, the days turned to weeks, and Lily couldn't shake off the feeling that Jane was avoiding her.\n\nFeeling rejected, Lily asked Jack if there was something going on between Jane and him. Jack, who had never been particularly perceptive, shrugged off the suggestion, and instead, tried to reassure Lily that everything was okay.\n\nBut everything wasn't okay, and Lily knew it. She couldn't quite put her finger on what was bothering her so much, but the awkwardness between her and Jane was becoming a constant burden. One day, things came to their boiling point.\n\nLily had been out shopping with Jane, picking up some groceries for a dinner party that they were planning for Jack's birthday. As they were walking back, Jane suddenly turned to Lily and asked: \"Can I ask you something?\"\n\nLily nodded, already feeling the weight of the exchange. \n\n\"Do you ever feel like it's hard being around me?\" Jane asked, hesitantly.\n\nLily didn't know how to reply. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nJane sighed, her eyes flickering downwards. \"I just have this feeling that I'm not good enough, that...I'm always going to be second best compared to Jack.\"\n\nLily didn't know what to say. She was supposed to be Jack's best friend, his loyal confidante, and here she was, grappling with the fact that she was having illicit feelings for his girlfriend. The confessional exchange between the two women only served to make Lily's internal conflict worse.\n\nBecause the truth was, Lily was struggling with her own feelings. Jane was undeniably beautiful, and she and Lily had many mutual interests. They could spend hours just talking about music, books, and their favorite TV shows. But Lily knew that she could never act on those feelings. Jack was her best friend, and he loved Jane. It would break his heart if he found out that Lily had somehow gotten in the way of his relationship.\n\nAs the day of Jack's birthday party approached, Lily found herself obsessing over her feelings for Jane, unable to detach herself from her own internal desires. When Jack and Jane arrived at Lily's house, she found herself freezing up, unsure of how to be friendly without crossing any boundaries.\n\nIt was then that Jack pulled her aside, whispering in her ear. \"You know you're the most important person in my life, right?\"\n\nLily nodded, her stomach churning. \"Of course.\"\n\nJack grinned, and then, pulling her into a bear hug, he added: \"I want you to know that I'm really happy that you and Jane are friends too. She's special to me, and so are you. And you know what they say, the more the merrier.\"\n\nLily tried to smile, but there was a lump in her throat, a sour taste in her mouth. She didn't want to betray Jack's trust, but she couldn't quite shake off the feeling that everything was somehow, inexorably falling apart.\n\nIn the end, the birthday party was a success. Everyone had fun, the food was excellent, and the mood was celebratory. But in the days and weeks after, the awkwardness between Jane and Lily remained.\n\nLily tried to avoid her, knowing that her feelings for Jane were getting in the way of her loyalty to Jack. She couldn't bear the thought of betraying her best friend, but she also couldn't suppress her own desires.\n\nAnd so, for Lily, the struggle continued, her heart waging a war between loyalty and desire.
