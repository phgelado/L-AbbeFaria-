The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma compared to standard clinical care on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes. This was a prospective parallel group repeated measurement randomized design. Participants were adults aged 18 to 80 years with asthma. The intervention consisted of six group sessions on the use of nutritional manipulation, yoga techniques, and journaling. Participants also received nutritional supplements: fish oil, vitamin C, and a standardized hops extract. The control group received usual care. Primary outcome measures were the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). In total, 154 patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (77 control, 77 treatment). Treatment participants showed greater improvement than controls at 6 months for the AQLQ total score (P<.001) and for three subscales, Activity (P< 0.001), Symptoms (P= .02), and Emotion (P<.001). Treatment participants also showed greater improvement than controls on three of the SF-12 subscales, Physical functioning (P=.003); Role limitations, Physical (P< .001); and Social functioning (P= 0.03), as well as in the aggregate scores for Physical and Mental health (P= .003 and .02, respectively). There was no change in PFTs in either group. A low-cost group-oriented integrative medicine intervention can lead to significant improvement in QOL in adults with asthma.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of EGb-761, a standardized extract given in capsule form, in treating TD in schizophrenia patients. Inpatients with DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia and TD (n = 157) in a mainland China Veterans Affairs psychiatric hospital were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with either EGb-761, 240 mg/d (n = 78) or a placebo (n = 79) in a double-blind manner. Primary outcome measures were (1) change from baseline in the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) score and (2) proportion of patients with a \u2265 30% reduction in their AIMS total score at week 12. Secondary outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and cognitive performance as measured by the Continuous Performance Test-37 Version and the 3-card Stroop task. Patients were recruited for the study between December 2006 and May 2007. Of the 157 patients who were randomly assigned, 152 (96.8%) completed the study. EGb-761 treatment significantly decreased the AIMS total score in patients with TD compared to those who were given a placebo (2.13 \u00b1 1.75 vs -0.10 \u00b1 1.69; P < .0001), with 40 (51.3%) and 4 (5.1%) patients achieving response in the EGb-761 and placebo treatment groups, respectively. There were no between-group differences in the PANSS total score or cognitive measures from baseline to week 12. EGb-761 appears to be an effective treatment for reducing the symptoms of TD in schizophrenia patients, and improvement may be mediated through the well-known antioxidant activity of this extract. clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00672373.

GSK233705 is an inhaled, long-acting muscarinic antagonist in development for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was performed to see if the addition of GSK233705 to salmeterol would provide greater bronchodilation than salmeterol or tiotropium alone in COPD. In an incomplete-block, three-period, crossover design, dually responsive patients received three of the following five treatments: GSK233705 20 \u03bcg plus salmeterol 50 \u03bcg twice-daily; GSK233705 50 \u03bcg plus salmeterol 50 \u03bcg twice-daily; salmeterol 50 \u03bcg or placebo, each twice-daily; and tiotropium 18 \u03bcg or placebo once-daily for 7 days. Each treatment period was separated by a 14-day washout. The primary efficacy endpoint was morning (trough) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) on Day 8, following 7 days of treatment. Secondary endpoints included pulmonary function, plethysmography, pharmacokinetics of GSK233705 and salmeterol, adverse events (AEs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and laboratory parameters. A total of 47 patients were randomized. The mean % predicted normal postbronchodilator FEV(1) was 55% at screening. Compared with placebo (n = 24), the adjusted mean change from baseline in trough FEV(1) on Day 8 was 215 mL higher with GSK233705 20 \u03bcg + salmeterol (n = 23) and 203 mL higher with GSK233705 50 \u03bcg + salmeterol (n = 27), whereas with salmeterol (n = 27) and tiotropium (n = 28) the changes were 101 mL and 118 mL higher, respectively. The primary efficacy results were supported by the results from the other secondary lung function assessments. AEs were reported by similar proportions of patients across the treatment groups, with headache the most frequently reported treatment-related AE reported by one subject receiving each of GSK233705 20 \u03bcg + salmeterol, tiotropium, and placebo.

Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in Japanese patients. In 2 randomized, open-label, multicenter studies, 80 Japanese patients with acute PE or DVT received either subcutaneous fondaparinux or intravenous UFH as a non-comparative reference, in a 3:1 ratio, for 5-10 days. Concomitant warfarin therapy was continued until Day 90. Multidetector-row computed tomography-based assessment showed that 57.9% and 45.9% of the patients with acute PE and acute proximal DVT had proximal DVT and PE as a complication, respectively. There was no recurrence of symptomatic venous thromboembolism. In the fondaparinux group, the respective improvement rates at the end of the initial treatment and follow-up periods were 71.4% and 86.8% for 42 patients with PE, and 57.8% and 83.3% for 46 patients with DVT; similar results were noted in the UFH group.

In this phase III study, 277 patients with moderate-to-severe acute low back pain were randomized to 1-2 tablets of DDS-06C or placebo every 10-12\u2009h for 2.5 days during the double-blind phase. Following the double-blind phase, patients had the option to continue for a 2.5-day open-label phase. Clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00643383) The primary end point was the sum of pain intensity differences (SPID) over the 50-h double-blind phase (SPID50). Secondary end points included total pain relief score over the 50-h double-blind phase (TOTPAR50), patient's global impression of medication, and SPID over the first 4\u2009h. A statistically significant (p\u2009=\u20090.038) greater decrease in pain intensity was observed in the DDS-06C group (median SPID50: -6.0) versus placebo (median SPID50: -4.0).

DDS-06C demonstrated statistically significant superior efficacy compared with placebo for the majority of the other secondary end points. Overall, 38% of patients treated with DDS-06C experienced at least one adverse event; the intensity was mild-to-moderate in 81% of cases. The most commonly reported adverse events (>5% of patients receiving DDS-06C) were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and somnolence.

Helicobacter pylori is associated with benign and malignant diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and increasing antibiotic resistance has made alternative treatments necessary. Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of a new, single-capsule treatment versus the gold standard for H pylori eradication. We did a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 39 sites in Europe, comparing the efficacy and safety of 10 days of quadruple therapy with omeprazole plus a single three-in-one capsule containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline (quadruple therapy) versus 7 days of omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (standard therapy) in adults with recorded H pylori infection. Patients were randomly assigned treatment according to a predetermined list independently generated by Quintiles Canada (Ville St-Laurent, QC, Canada). Our study was designed as a non-inferiority trial but was powered to detect superiority. Our primary outcome was H pylori eradication, established by two negative (13)C urea breath tests at a minimum of 28 and 56 days after the end of treatment. Our assessment for non-inferiority was in the per-protocol population, with subsequent assessment for superiority in the intention-to-treat population (ie, all participants randomly assigned treatment). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00669955. 12 participants were lost to follow-up and 101 were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol population (n=339), the lower bound of the CI for treatment with quadruple therapy was greater than the pre-established non-inferiority margin of -10% (95% CI 15\u00b71-32\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001). In the intention-to-treat population (n=440), eradication rates were 80% (174 of 218 participants) in the quadruple therapy group versus 55% (123 of 222) in the standard therapy group (p<0\u00b70001). Safety profiles for both treatments were similar; main adverse events were gastrointestinal and CNS disorders. Quadruple therapy should be considered for first-line treatment in view of the rising prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H pylori, especially since quadruple therapy provides superior eradication with similar safety and tolerability to standard therapy.

The effect of roflumilast on lung function in patients with COPD that is moderate to severe who are already being treated with salmeterol or tiotropium was investigated. In two double-blind, multicentre studies done in an outpatient setting, after a 4-week run-in, patients older than 40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomly assigned to oral roflumilast 500 microg or placebo once a day for 24 weeks, in addition to salmeterol (M2-127 study) or tiotropium (M2-128 study). The primary endpoint was change in prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Analysis was by intention to treat. The studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00313209 for M2-127, and NCT00424268 for M2-128. In the salmeterol plus roflumilast trial, 466 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 467 with placebo; in the tiotropium plus roflumilast trial, 371 patients were assigned to and treated with roflumilast and 372 with placebo. Compared with placebo, roflumilast consistently improved mean prebronchodilator FEV(1) by 49 mL (p<0.0001) in patients treated with salmeterol, and 80 mL (p<0.0001) in those treated with tiotropium. Similar improvement in postbronchodilator FEV(1) was noted in both groups. Furthermore, roflumilast had beneficial effects on other lung function measurements and on selected patient-reported outcomes in both groups. Nausea, diarrhoea, weight loss, and, to a lesser extent, headache were more frequent in patients in the roflumilast groups. These adverse events were associated with increased patient withdrawal. Roflumilast improves lung function in patients with COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium, and could become an important treatment for these patients. Nycomed.

The goal of this study was to assess the immunogenicity and antigenicity of StrataGraft skin tissue in a randomized phase I/II clinical trial for the temporary management of full-thickness skin loss. StrataGraft skin tissue consists of a dermal equivalent containing human dermal fibroblasts and a fully stratified, biologically active epidermis derived from Near-diploid Immortalized Keratinocyte S (NIKS) cells, a pathogen-free, long-lived, consistent, human keratinocyte progenitor. Traumatic skin wounds often require temporary allograft coverage to stabilize the wound bed until autografting is possible. StrataGraft and cadaveric allograft were placed side by side on 15 patients with full-thickness skin defects for 1 week before autografting. Allografts were removed from the wound bed and examined for allogeneic immune responses. Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence were used to assess tissue structure and cellular composition of allografts. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation assays, chromium-release assays, and development of antibodies were used to examine allogeneic responses. One week after patient exposure to allografts, there were no differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes or Langerhans cells present in StrataGraft skin substitute compared to cadaver allograft, the standard of care. Importantly, exposure to StrataGraft skin substitute did not induce the proliferation of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells to NIKS keratinocytes or enhance cell-mediated lysis of NIKS keratinocytes in vitro. Similarly, no evidence of antibody generation targeted to the NIKS keratinocytes was seen. These findings indicate that StrataGraft tissue is well-tolerated and not acutely immunogenic in patients with traumatic skin wounds. Notably, exposure to StrataGraft did not increase patient sensitivity toward or elicit immune responses against the NIKS keratinocytes. We envision that this novel skin tissue technology will be widely used to facilitate the healing of traumatic cutaneous wounds.This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00618839).
