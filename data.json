            "answer": "Downstream spillovers refer to the impact of domestic growth surprises in G20 EMs on firms that rely heavily on intermediate goods produced in those countries. There are two transmission channels: cheaper supplies, which can benefit firms, and competition from foreign imports, which can harm them."

        {
            "question": "How do growth spillovers work for firms?",
            "answer": "Growth spillovers occur when a positive shock (such as a 1% increase) to aggregate demand or supply in one country has a ripple effect on the economies of other countries, potentially leading to higher revenue growth for firms that rely heavily on demand from emerging markets."
