# L'Abbe Faria

Abbe Faria is a fine-tuned Mistral model that serves as an advisor and mentor, fine-tuned on synthetically generated conversations between two Mistral personnas, a younger and older version of the same person and their advice. 

The objective of the model is to provide a way for users to breakdown and reflect on their issues by chatting, in a way similar to journaling, that is private, interactive and uplifting. 

> Abbe Faria: Here is your final lesson - do not commit the crime for which you now serve the sentence. God said, Vengeance is mine.  
 Edmond Dantes: I don't believe in God.  
 Abbe Faria: It doesn't matter. He believes in you.
