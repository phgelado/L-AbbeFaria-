# L'Abbe Faria

Abbe Faria is a fine-tuned Mistral model that serves as an advisor and mentor, fine-tuned on synthetically generated conversations between two Mistral personnas, a younger and older version of the same person who share questions and advice.

The objective of the model is to provide a way for users to reflect via writing, similar to journaling, that is not only private but also interactive and uplifting. 

Abbe Faria is character from Alexandre Dumas' "Le Comte De Monte Cristo", who imprisoned for life in the most squalid conditions but finds purpose in passing on his knowledge (and more but I won't do spoilers!) to Edmond Dantes. 

> **Abbe Faria:** Here is your final lesson - do not commit the crime for which you now serve the sentence. God said, Vengeance is mine.  
> **Edmond Dantes:** I don't believe in God.  
> **Abbe Faria:** It doesn't matter. He believes in you.
