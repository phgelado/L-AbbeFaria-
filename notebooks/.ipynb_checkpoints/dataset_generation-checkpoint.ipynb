Setting boundaries will help prevent burnout and ensure that you have the time and energy to focus on what truly matters.\\n3. Practice mindfulness: Being present and fully engaged in the moment can help reduce stress and anxiety. Try incorporating mindfulness practices like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery into your daily routine.\\n4. Seek support: Don\\'t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional when you need help.
